        Edrea and Simon met in 10th grade computer science class where Simon discovered the joys of programming in Turing and Edrea enjoyed annoying him. After the semester was over, they continued to talk over the phone and hang out every week. Later that summer, Edrea finally got the gusto to ask Simon out, and they went on their first date.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 4 years of long distance dating at university, 2 years of flying between Vancouver and New York, and countless Skype calls, Simon and Edrea got jobs in Seattle and finally moved in together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two years after moving to Seattle, Simon took Edrea to Kerry Park on a warm summer's day and proposed.
